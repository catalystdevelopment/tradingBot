# tradingBot
just a bot that trades on coinbase (currently), use it to DCA!

An automated trading bot for Coinbase Pro, it's a bit rudimentary, but will:
- a) teach you about programming
- b) help you learn about finance
- c) help you understand exchanges
- d) be able to automate your trades

'tradingBot/cbpro.py' is where much of the magic happens, the other files are for authentication and auxillary functions.
this tool can be built out to work for multiple exchanges and in the future, defi protocols.

Happy trading!
